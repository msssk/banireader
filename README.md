Bani Reader provides a clean view of bani intended for reading on a computer screen. Bani is loaded from the
[SikhiToTheMax](https://www.sikhitothemax.org/) API.

## Using Bani Reader

The initial screen allows you to select which source you would like to read from. At this point it is recommended to
either enable fullscreen or at least size and position your browser the way you want to keep it while reading. The
text layout is only somewhat responsive to changes in window or font size, so it may take a few pages of navigating to
catch up to any changes.
After selecting a source you will see the first page of bani displayed. While reading bani you can press <kbd>h</kbd>
at any time to bring up help and options.

decrease the font size until everything can be read. Be sure to increase the font size before navigating to the next
page.
